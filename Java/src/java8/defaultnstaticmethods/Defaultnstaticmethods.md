## 1. Default Methods

In Java 8, default methods were introduced as a feature to extend the capabilities of interfaces without breaking the classes that implement those interfaces. Prior to Java 8, interfaces could only declare method signatures that had to be implemented by the classes implementing the interface. This posed a problem when there was a need to add new methods to an existing interface, as all implementing classes would have to be modified to provide implementations for the new methods.

Default methods allow interfaces to provide method implementations directly within the interface itself. This means that classes implementing the interface don't need to provide an implementation for the default methods if they don't want to. However, they can still override these default methods if they need to provide custom implementations.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```java
interface MyInterface {
    void regularMethod();

    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void regularMethod() {
        System.out.println("Implementing the regular method.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
        myObj.regularMethod();    // Output: Implementing the regular method.
        myObj.defaultMethod();    // Output: This is a default method.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyInterface` defines a default method called `defaultMethod()`. The `MyClass` class implements the interface and provides an implementation for the `regularMethod()`. Since `defaultMethod()` is already implemented in the interface, `MyClass` inherits that implementation.

Default methods are particularly useful when you want to introduce new functionality to an existing interface without breaking existing code that implements the interface. They allow for gradual evolution of interfaces over time without causing compatibility issues with existing implementations.

## 2. Static methods

In Java 8, static methods in interfaces were introduced as part of the same effort to enhance interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Prior to Java 8, interfaces could only declare instance method signatures, but Java 8 allowed interfaces to include static methods as well.

Static methods in interfaces behave similarly to static methods in classes. They are associated with the interface itself, not with instances of classes that implement the interface. These methods can be called directly using the interface name, without needing to create an instance of a class that implements the interface.

Here's an example:

```java
interface MyInterface {
    void regularMethod();

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method in the interface.");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void regularMethod() {
        System.out.println("Implementing the regular method.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
        myObj.regularMethod();      // Output: Implementing the regular method.
        MyInterface.staticMethod(); // Output: This is a static method in the interface.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyInterface` defines a static method called `staticMethod()`. The `MyClass` class implements the interface and provides an implementation for the `regularMethod()`. The `staticMethod()` can be directly called using the interface name, without creating an instance of any class.

Static methods in interfaces are often used for utility methods that are related to the functionality of the interface, but don't require an instance of a specific class. They provide a way to organize code and make it more modular.
