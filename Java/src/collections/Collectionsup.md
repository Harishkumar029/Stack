1. **Introduction to Collections Framework:**
   - Overview of Collection, Set, List, and Map interfaces.
   - Differences between Collection and Collections.

2. **List Interface and Implementations:**
   - ArrayList
   - LinkedList
   - Vector
   - Stack

3. **Set Interface and Implementations:**
   - HashSet
   - LinkedHashSet
   - TreeSet

4. **Map Interface and Implementations:**
   - HashMap
   - LinkedHashMap
   - TreeMap
   - Hashtable

5. **Queue Interface and Implementations:**
   - PriorityQueue
   - ArrayDeque
   - LinkedList (can act as a queue)

6. **Iterators and Iterables:**
   - Using iterators to traverse collections.
   - Enhanced for loop (for-each) and its usage.

7. **Comparable and Comparator:**
   - Implementing the `Comparable` interface for natural ordering.
   - Creating custom comparators using the `Comparator` interface.

8. **Collection Algorithms:**
   - Sorting lists using `Collections.sort()`.
   - Binary search using `Collections.binarySearch()`.

9. **Concurrency and Collections:**
   - Thread-safe collections: `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `CopyOnWriteArraySet`, etc.
   - Synchronization of non-thread-safe collections.

10. **Collections Utilities:**
    - `Collections` class methods for manipulation and searching.
    - `Arrays` class methods for working with arrays.

# 1. Overview of Collection, Set, List, and Map interfaces.

1. **Collection Interface:**
   - The `Collection` interface is the root interface of the Java Collections Framework.
   - It represents a group of objects, known as elements, and provides general-purpose methods to manipulate collections.
   - It does not define any specific ordering or uniqueness guarantees for the elements.
   - Some common methods: `add`, `remove`, `contains`, `size`, `isEmpty`.

2. **Set Interface:**
   - The `Set` interface is a subinterface of `Collection`.
   - It represents a collection of unique elements. Each element can appear only once in a set.
   - The ordering of elements might not be guaranteed (except in certain implementations like `LinkedHashSet`).
   - Some common implementations: `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`.

3. **List Interface:**
   - The `List` interface is a subinterface of `Collection`.
   - It represents an ordered collection of elements, where elements can be duplicates.
   - Elements are accessed by their index in the list.
   - Common implementations: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`, `Stack`.

4. **Map Interface:**
   - The `Map` interface represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   - Each key is associated with exactly one value. Keys are unique, but values can be duplicated.
   - It does not extend the `Collection` interface due to its distinct nature.
   - Common implementations: `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`, `Hashtable`.
