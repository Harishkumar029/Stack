       // Perform operations on the element
   }
   ```

14. What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
    - Answer: Fail-fast iterators immediately throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified while iterating. Fail-safe iterators, on the other hand, create a copy of the collection and iterate over the copy, so they do not throw any exception if the collection is modified.

    - Answer: The `Comparable` interface in Java is used to define the natural ordering of elements in a class. It requires implementing the `compareTo()` method, which returns a negative value if the object is less than the compared object, zero if they are equal, and a positive value if the object is greater.

   ```java
   class MyClass implements Comparable<MyClass> {
       private int value;

       public MyClass(int value) {
           this.value = value;
       }

       @Override
       public int compareTo(MyClass other) {
           return this.value - other.value;
       }
   }
   ```

16. What is the `Comparator` interface in Java?
    - Answer: The `Comparator` interface in Java is used to define custom ordering of elements in a class that does not implement `Comparable`. It requires implementing the `compare()` method, which returns a negative value if the first object is less than the second, zero if they are equal, and a positive value if the first object is greater.

   ```java
   class MyComparator implements Comparator<MyClass> {
       @Override
       public int compare(MyClass obj1, MyClass obj2) {

   ```java
   class MyClass {
       private int id;

       public MyClass(int id) {
           this.id = id;
       }

       @Override
       public boolean equals(Object other) {
           if (this == other) {
               return true;
           }
           if (!(other instanceof MyClass)) {
               return false;
           }
           MyClass otherObj = (MyClass) other;
           return this.id == otherObj.id;
       }
