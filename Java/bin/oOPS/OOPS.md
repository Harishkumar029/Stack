Sure! Here are Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) interview questions with answers:

1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**
   - Answer: Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on representing real-world entities as objects and using concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to design and implement software systems.

2. **What are the four fundamental principles of OOP?**
   - Answer: The four fundamental principles of OOP are:
     - Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (object).
     - Inheritance: Creating a new class (subclass) from an existing class (superclass) to inherit its properties and behaviors.
     - Polymorphism: Providing a single interface to multiple entities, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly.
     - Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details and exposing only relevant features to the outside world.

3. **What is a class in Java?**
   - Answer: A class in Java is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (methods) of objects. It acts as a blueprint from which objects are created.

4. **What is an object in Java?**
   - Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates its state (data) and behavior (methods).

5. **What is the difference between a class and an object?**
   - Answer: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of objects, whereas an object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity created using the class blueprint.

6. **How do you create an object in Java?**
   - Answer: To create an object in Java, you use the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor:
     ```java
     MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
     ```

7. **What is the constructor in Java?**
   - Answer: A constructor is a special method in a class that is used to initialize the object's state when it is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.
   In Java, a constructor is a special method within a class that is responsible for initializing objects of that class. When you create an object using the `new` keyword, the constructor is automatically called to set up the initial state of the object. The constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type, not even `void`.

Key characteristics of constructors:

1. **Name:** The name of the constructor is the same as the class name.

2. **No Return Type:** Unlike regular methods, constructors do not have a return type, not even `void`. They implicitly return the object they initialize.

3. **Initialization:** Constructors are used to set initial values to the instance variables of the object and perform any other necessary setup tasks.

4. **Implicit Call:** When you create an object using the `new` keyword, Java automatically calls the constructor to initialize the object.

5. **Overloading:** You can define multiple constructors for a class with different parameter lists. This is known as constructor overloading.

Here's an example of a class with a constructor:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor with parameters
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Default constructor (no parameters)
    public Person() {
        // Default values
        this.name = "Unknown";
        this.age = 0;
    }

    // Other methods of the class
    // ...
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create objects using constructors
        Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        Person person2 = new Person();

        // Access object properties
        System.out.println(person1.name + " is " + person1.age + " years old.");
        System.out.println(person2.name + " is " + person2.age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we have a class `Person` with two constructors: one that takes `name` and `age` as parameters, and another default constructor without any parameters. When we create `person1` using the parameterized constructor, we set the `name` and `age` of the object. When we create `person2` using the default constructor, the object is initialized with default values.

8. **What are the access modifiers in Java?**
   - Answer: Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables in Java. There are four access modifiers:
     - `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
     - `protected`: Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
     - `default` (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.
     - `private`: Accessible only within the same class.

     - In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to specify the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, and variables in different parts of your code. There are four main access modifiers in Java:

        - **Public:** The `public` access modifier allows a class, method, or variable to be accessible from anywhere in the program. It has the widest scope.

        - **Private:** The `private` access modifier restricts the visibility of a class member (method or variable) to within the same class only. It is used to encapsulate the implementation details and hide them from external access.

        - **Protected:** The `protected` access modifier allows a class member to be accessed within the same class, subclasses (in any package), and other classes in the same package. It is useful for providing controlled access to certain members.

        - **Default (Package-private):** When no access modifier is specified, it is considered the default access modifier. It allows access within the same package but restricts access from outside the package.

        Here's a summary of how these access modifiers work:

                | Access Modifier | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
                |-----------------|-------|---------|----------|-------|
                | `public`        | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes   |
                | `protected`     | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | No    |
                | Default         | Yes   | Yes     | No       | No    |
                | `private`       | Yes   | No      | No       | No    |

        Examples:

        1. **Public:**
        ```java
        public class PublicExample {
            public int publicVar;
            public void publicMethod() {
                // Method logic
            }
        }
        ```

        2. **Private:**
        ```java
        public class PrivateExample {
            private int privateVar;
            private void privateMethod() {
                // Method logic
            }
        }
        ```

        3. **Protected:**
        ```java
        public class ProtectedExample {
            protected int protectedVar;
            protected void protectedMethod() {
                // Method logic
            }
        }
        ```

        4. **Default (Package-private):**
        ```java
        class DefaultExample {
            int defaultVar;
            void defaultMethod() {
                // Method logic
            }
        }
        ```

        It's essential to use access modifiers thoughtfully to control the accessibility of your class members and ensure proper encapsulation and data hiding in your code.

9. **What is encapsulation in Java?**
   - Answer: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It helps to hide the internal implementation details and allows access to the data only through defined methods (getters and setters).

10. **What is inheritance in Java?**
    - Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a new class (subclass) is created from an existing class (superclass), inheriting its properties and behaviors. The subclass can extend the functionality of the superclass and also have its own unique features.

11. **How do you achieve multiple inheritance in Java?**
    - Answer: Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes (i.e., a class cannot extend more than one class). However, it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, where a class can implement multiple interfaces.

12. **What is the `super` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `super` keyword is used in a subclass to refer to its superclass. It is used to call the superclass's constructor, access its methods, or access its variables that are hidden by the subclass.

13. **What is polymorphism in Java?**
    - Answer: Polymorphism is the ability of a method to take on different forms. In Java, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

14. **What is method overriding in Java?**
    - Answer: Method overriding is a feature in Java where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same method signature (name and parameters) as the method in the superclass.

15. **What is method overloading in Java?**
    - Answer: Method overloading is a feature in Java where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The methods must have different parameter types or a different number of parameters.

16. **What is the difference between `static` and non-`static` methods in Java?**
    - Answer: `static` methods belong to the class and can be called using the class name without creating an object. Non-`static` methods are associated with objects and can only be called on object instances.

17. **What is an abstract class in Java?**
    - Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may have abstract (unimplemented) methods. It serves as a blueprint for its subclasses, which must implement the abstract methods.

18. **What is an interface in Java?**
    - Answer: An interface is a reference type in Java that contains only abstract method declarations, constant fields, and default methods (with Java 8 onwards). It defines a contract that implementing classes must follow.

19. **Can you create an object of an abstract class or an interface?**
    - Answer: No, you cannot create objects of abstract classes or interfaces. You can create objects of concrete subclasses that extend the abstract class or implement the interface.

20. **What is the `final` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `final` keyword can be applied to classes, methods, and variables. When applied to a class, it means the class cannot be subclassed. When applied to a method, it means the method cannot be overridden. When applied to a variable, it means the variable cannot be changed (i.e., it becomes a constant).

21. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and method parameters that have the same name.

22. **What are the Object class methods in Java?**
    - Answer: The `Object` class is the superclass of all other classes in Java, and it provides some common methods that can be used by all objects, such as `equals()`, `toString()`, `hashCode()`, etc.

23. **What is the `toString()` method in Java?**
    - Answer: The `toString()` method is a method of the `Object` class that is overridden in many classes to return a string representation of the object's state. It is commonly used to print the object's content for debugging purposes.

24. **What is the `equals()` method in Java?**
    - Answer: The `equals()` method is used to compare the content (i.e., values) of two objects for equality. It is commonly used to check if two objects have the same state.

25. **What is the `hashCode()` method in Java?**
    - Answer: The `hashCode()` method returns a unique integer value associated with an object. It is used by data structures like hash tables to

 efficiently store and retrieve objects.

26. **What is a singleton design pattern in Java?**
    - Answer: The singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used when you need to have a single instance shared across the application.

27. **What is a factory design pattern in Java?**
    - Answer: The factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but it allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling and follows the principle of "programming to an interface, not an implementation."

28. **What is a design pattern?**
    - Answer: A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common software design problem. It provides a structured approach to solving specific design issues and promotes best practices in software development.

29. **What is the difference between composition and inheritance?**
    - Answer: Composition and inheritance are two ways of achieving code reuse in Java:
      - Composition: It involves creating an object of another class within a class to reuse its functionalities.
      - Inheritance: It involves creating a new class from an existing class to inherit its properties and behaviors.

30. **What is the `instanceof` operator in Java?**
    - Answer: The `instanceof` operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or implements a specific interface. It returns `true` if the object is an instance of the given class or interface; otherwise, it returns `false`.

31. **How do you implement encapsulation in Java?**
    - Answer: Encapsulation in Java is achieved by using access modifiers to control access to the class's fields and methods. You declare the class fields as `private` and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the fields, respectively.

32. **How do you achieve method overriding in Java?**
    - Answer: Method overriding in Java is achieved by providing a specific implementation for a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same method signature (name and parameters) as the method in the superclass, and it should use the `@Override` annotation to indicate that it is intended to override a superclass method.

33. **What is dynamic binding (runtime polymorphism) in Java?**
    - Answer: Dynamic binding, also known as runtime polymorphism, is a mechanism in Java where the actual method call is determined at runtime based on the type of the object, rather than at compile-time. It allows a method in the subclass to override a method in the superclass and be dynamically called based on the object's type at runtime.

34. **What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` in Java?**
    - Answer: 
      - `final`: It is a keyword used to make a class not extendable, a method not overrideable, or a variable a constant that cannot be reassigned.
      - `finally`: It is a block used in exception handling to ensure that a set of statements is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
      - `finalize`: It is a method in the `Object` class that is called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed to perform cleanup operations. However, it is rarely used, and it is generally recommended to use the `AutoCloseable` interface or try-with-resources for resource management.

35. **What is method hiding in Java?**
    - Answer: Method hiding in Java occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in its superclass. The subclass method "hides" the superclass method, and the method call is determined based on the reference type, not the actual object type.

36. **What is the `static` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `static` keyword is used to indicate that a member (variable or method) belongs to the class, rather than to any specific instance of the class. It means the member can be accessed without creating an object of the class.

37. **What are abstract methods in Java?**
    - Answer: Abstract methods are methods in an abstract class or interface that are declared but have no implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class or implementing classes of the interface must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.

38. **What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?**
    - Answer: An abstract class can have both abstract (unimplemented) methods and concrete (implemented) methods. It may have instance variables and constructors. A class can extend only one abstract class.
    - An interface can only have abstract methods (Java 7 and below), but it can also have default and static methods (Java 8 onwards). It cannot have instance variables or constructors. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

39. **What are the advantages of using interfaces in Java?**
    - Answer: Interfaces provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java. They allow classes to implement multiple interfaces, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in design. Interfaces also help define a contract that implementing classes must follow, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

40. **How do you implement multiple interfaces in a class?**
    - Answer: To implement multiple interfaces in a class, you use the `implements` keyword followed by a comma-separated list of interfaces:
      ```java
      public class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
          // Class implementation here
      }
      ```

41. **What is the use of the `default` keyword in Java interfaces?**
    - Answer: The `default` keyword is used to define a default implementation for a method in a Java interface. It allows adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking backward compatibility for implementing classes.

42. **What is a nested class in Java?**
    - Answer: A nested class in Java is a class that is defined within another class. There are four types of nested classes in Java: static nested class, non-static (inner) class, local class, and anonymous class.

43. **What is an inner class in Java?**
    - Answer: An inner class in Java is a non-static nested class that is defined within another class. It has access to the members (variables and methods) of the enclosing class.

44. **What is a static nested class in Java?**
    - Answer: A static nested class in Java is a nested class that is defined as a static member of the enclosing class. It behaves like a regular top-level class and does not have access to the instance members of the enclosing class.

45. **What is an anonymous inner class in Java?**
    - Answer: An anonymous inner class in Java is a local inner class without a name. It is defined and instantiated in a single expression, typically used for providing a one-time implementation of an interface or an abstract class.

46. **What is method chaining in Java?**
    - Answer: Method chaining is a programming technique in Java where multiple method calls are chained together in a single statement, allowing concise and readable code. Each method call returns an object (usually the current object), which is used for the next method call.

47. **What is the `instanceof` operator used for?**
    - Answer: The `instanceof` operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or implements a specific interface. It returns `true` if the object is an instance of the given class or interface;

 otherwise, it returns `false`.

48. **What is the purpose of the `final` keyword when applied to variables?**
    - Answer: When the `final` keyword is applied to variables in Java, it indicates that the variable's value cannot be changed once it is initialized. It becomes a constant, and attempting to reassign its value will result in a compilation error.

49. **What is a constructor chaining in Java?**
    - Answer: Constructor chaining in Java is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class or between a subclass and its superclass. This allows the initialization of common attributes in one place and avoids code duplication.

50. **How do you prevent a class from being inherited in Java?**
    - Answer: To prevent a class from being inherited in Java, you can declare the class as `final`. A final class cannot be subclassed, and any attempt to extend it will result in a compilation error.

51. **What is the `protected` access modifier used for?**
    - Answer: The `protected` access modifier allows access to class members within the same package and by subclasses outside the package. It provides a level of encapsulation and is commonly used to make certain members accessible to subclasses while still restricting access to other classes outside the package.

52. **How do you implement encapsulation using access specifiers?**
    - Answer: Encapsulation in Java is implemented using access specifiers such as `public`, `private`, `protected`, and the default (package-private) access. By declaring variables as `private` and providing public getter and setter methods, you control access to the data and ensure data integrity.

53. **What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Java?**
    - Answer: Shallow copy creates a new object and copies the references of the data from the original object to the new object. Both the original and the copied object will refer to the same data, which means changes made to the data in one object will be reflected in the other. In contrast, deep copy creates a new object and copies the data itself to the new object. The copied object and the original object will have separate copies of the data, so changes made to one object's data will not affect the other.

54. **What is a package in Java?**
    - Answer: A package in Java is a way to organize classes and interfaces into groups. It helps to avoid naming conflicts and provides a hierarchical structure to the Java code. Packages are specified using the `package` statement at the beginning of a Java file.

55. **How do you create and use packages in Java?**
    - Answer: To create a package in Java, you create a directory with the package name and place the Java files inside that directory. The package declaration in the Java files should match the directory structure. To use a package, you either import specific classes from the package or import the entire package using the `import` statement.

56. **What is the `import` statement used for in Java?**
    - Answer: The `import` statement in Java is used to make classes and interfaces from other packages accessible within the current class without having to use the fully qualified class name (i.e., package name followed by class name).

57. **What is method visibility in Java?**
    - Answer: Method visibility in Java refers to the accessibility of a method from different classes and packages. The visibility is controlled by access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, and the default) and determines whether a method can be called from outside the class or package.

58. **How do you implement method overloading in Java?**
    - Answer: Method overloading in Java is achieved by defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists in the same class. The methods must have different parameter types or a different number of parameters.

59. **What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?**
    - Answer: Method overloading occurs within the same class, where multiple methods have the same name but different parameter lists. Method overloading does not involve inheritance and does not change the method signature. Method overriding occurs between a superclass and a subclass, where the subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass. Method overriding changes the method signature and involves polymorphism.

60. **How do you handle exceptions in Java?**
    - Answer: In Java, you can handle exceptions using the try-catch block. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, and the potential exception is caught and handled in the `catch` block. You can also use the `finally` block to ensure certain code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

61. **What are checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?**
    - Answer: Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be either caught and handled or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException` and `SQLException`. Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, do not need to be caught or declared. Examples include `NullPointerException` and `ArithmeticException`.

62. **What is the purpose of the `throws` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `throws` keyword in Java is used to declare that a method may throw a particular type of exception. It allows propagating the exception to the calling method, which can then catch and handle the exception or rethrow it further.

63. **How do you create custom exceptions in Java?**
    - Answer: To create a custom exception in Java, you need to extend the `Exception` class (for checked exceptions) or the `RuntimeException` class (for unchecked exceptions). By creating a new class that extends these classes, you can define your own custom exception types.

64. **What are constructor references in Java 8?**
    - Answer: Constructor references in Java 8 are a shorthand notation for creating lambda expressions that call constructors. They allow you to pass a constructor as an argument to a method that expects a functional interface.

65. **What is a lambda expression in Java 8?**
    - Answer: A lambda expression in Java 8 is a concise representation of an anonymous function. It allows you to treat functionality as a method argument or code as data, improving code readability and maintainability.

66. **What are functional interfaces in Java 8?**
    - Answer: Functional interfaces in Java 8 are interfaces that have exactly one abstract method. They are used to support lambda expressions and method references. The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is optional but can be used to ensure the interface has only one abstract method.

67. **What is the purpose of the `default` keyword in Java 8 interfaces?**
    - Answer: The `default` keyword in Java 8 interfaces is used to provide a default implementation for a method. It allows adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking backward compatibility for implementing classes.

68. **What is the `Stream` API in Java 8?**
    - Answer: The `Stream` API in Java 8 is a new addition that provides a more functional approach to processing collections of data. It allows performing aggregate operations on data, such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and sorting, using a pipeline of stream operations.

69. **How do you iterate over a `List` in Java?**
    - Answer: There are several ways to iterate over a `List` in Java, such as using a traditional `for`

 loop, an enhanced `for` loop (for-each loop), the `Iterator` interface, or the `Stream` API introduced in Java 8.

70. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**
    - Answer: `ArrayList` is implemented as a dynamic array, which allows fast access to elements by index but may be slower for insertion and deletion. `LinkedList` is implemented as a doubly-linked list, which allows fast insertion and deletion but may be slower for random access.

71. **How do you remove duplicates from an ArrayList in Java?**
    - Answer: To remove duplicates from an `ArrayList` in Java, you can convert it into a `Set`, as a `Set` does not allow duplicate elements. Then, if needed, convert it back to an `ArrayList`.

72. **What is the `Collections` class in Java?**
    - Answer: The `Collections` class in Java is a utility class that provides static methods for working with collections, such as sorting, searching, and synchronization.

73. **What is the `Comparator` interface in Java?**
    - Answer: The `Comparator` interface in Java is used to define custom sorting orders for objects. It allows you to compare two objects and specify their ordering based on specific criteria.

74. **How do you sort objects in Java?**
    - Answer: To sort objects in Java, you can use the `Collections.sort()` method if the objects' class implements the `Comparable` interface. Alternatively, you can provide a custom `Comparator` implementation and pass it to the `Collections.sort()` method for sorting.

75. **What are Java annotations and how do you use them?**
    - Answer: Java annotations are a form of metadata that can be added to code elements like classes, methods, fields, and packages. They provide additional information to the compiler or runtime environment. Annotations are used by the Java compiler, build tools, and frameworks to generate code, configure behaviors, and perform other tasks.

76. **What are the different types of annotations in Java?**
    - Answer: Java annotations can be categorized into three types based on their retention policy:
      - `SOURCE`: Annotations are discarded by the compiler and do not appear in the bytecode.
      - `CLASS`: Annotations are retained in the bytecode but not accessible at runtime.
      - `RUNTIME`: Annotations are retained in the bytecode and accessible at runtime through reflection.

77. **What is the purpose of the `@Override` annotation in Java?**
    - Answer: The `@Override` annotation in Java is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method with the same name and parameter list in its superclass. It helps catch errors at compile-time if the method signature does not match any method in the superclass.

78. **What is the `equals()` method used for?**
    - Answer: The `equals()` method is used to compare the content (i.e., values) of two objects for equality. It is commonly used to check if two objects have the same state.

79. **How do you create an immutable class in Java?**
    - Answer: To create an immutable class in Java, you need to follow these guidelines:
      - Declare the class as `final` to prevent subclassing.
      - Make all the fields `private` and `final`.
      - Do not provide setter methods for the fields.
      - Provide only getter methods to access the fields.
      - Ensure that the class does not expose any mutable objects.

80. **What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to mark a variable as "volatile," meaning that its value may be modified by multiple threads. It ensures that any thread reading the variable gets the most up-to-date value, even if it is modified by another thread.

81. **What is multithreading in Java?**
    - Answer: Multithreading in Java is the concurrent execution of multiple threads within the same process. Each thread runs independently and can perform different tasks simultaneously.

82. **How do you create and start a thread in Java?**
    - Answer: To create and start a thread in Java, you can either extend the `Thread` class and override the `run()` method or implement the `Runnable` interface and provide a `run()` method. Then, you create an instance of the thread class or the runnable object and call the `start()` method to start the thread.

83. **What is the `Runnable` interface used for in Java threads?**
    - Answer: The `Runnable` interface in Java is used to define a task that a thread will execute. It represents a task or job that can be executed concurrently by multiple threads.

84. **How do you synchronize threads in Java?**
    - Answer: Thread synchronization in Java is achieved using the `synchronized` keyword. You can use the `synchronized` keyword to define a synchronized block or mark a method as synchronized. This ensures that only one thread at a time can access the synchronized block or method, preventing data corruption and race conditions.

85. **What is deadlock in Java multithreading?**
    - Answer: Deadlock in Java multithreading occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. This situation halts the progress of all threads involved.

86. **How do you prevent deadlock in Java?**
    - Answer: Deadlock prevention in Java can be achieved by following good programming practices, such as:
      - Avoiding circular resource dependencies.
      - Acquiring resources in a fixed order.
      - Using timeouts or interrupts for resource acquisition.
      - Using higher-level concurrency utilities like `java.util.concurrent` classes.

87. **What is the `ThreadLocal` class used for in Java?**
    - Answer: The `ThreadLocal` class in Java is used to create thread-local variables. Each thread that accesses a thread-local variable has its own, independently initialized copy of the variable.

88. **What is a Java bean?**
    - Answer: A Java bean is a class that follows certain conventions, such as providing a default (no-argument) constructor, private fields with public getter and setter methods, and implementing the `Serializable` interface. Java beans are used in various frameworks and technologies, such as JavaBeans API, Java Persistence API (JPA), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).

89. **What are the rules for creating a Java bean?**
    - Answer: The rules for creating a Java bean are as follows:
      - The class must have a default (no-argument) constructor.
      - The class must have private fields with public getter and setter methods for those fields.
      - The class should implement the `Serializable` interface if it needs to be serialized.

90. **How do you serialize and deserialize objects in Java?**
    - Answer: Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be saved to a file or sent over the network. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting the byte stream back into an object.

91. **What is the `Serializable` interface used for?**
    - Answer: The `Serializable` interface in Java is a marker interface used to indicate that a class can be serialized. It does not contain any methods and acts as a flag for the Java runtime to determine whether an object of

 the class can be converted into a byte stream.

92. **What is garbage collection in Java?**
    - Answer: Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use or are unreachable. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automatically manages memory and frees up memory used by objects that are no longer referenced.

93. **What are the different types of garbage collectors in Java?**
    - Answer: Java supports several garbage collection algorithms, such as:
      - Serial Garbage Collector (SerialGC)
      - Parallel Garbage Collector (ParallelGC)
      - Garbage-First Garbage Collector (G1GC)
      - Concurrent Mark Sweep Garbage Collector (CMS)

94. **What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?**
    - Answer: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract machine that enables Java bytecode to be executed on different platforms without modification. It interprets Java bytecode or, in some cases, just-in-time (JIT) compiles it into native machine code for execution.

95. **What is the `finalize()` method used for?**
    - Answer: The `finalize()` method is a method of the `Object` class that is called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed to perform cleanup operations. However, it is generally recommended not to rely on the `finalize()` method for resource cleanup and to use the `AutoCloseable` interface or try-with-resources instead.

96. **What is the `AutoCloseable` interface used for?**
    - Answer: The `AutoCloseable` interface in Java is used for classes that represent resources that need to be released or closed when they are no longer needed. Classes implementing `AutoCloseable` must provide an implementation for the `close()` method, which is automatically called when used with try-with-resources blocks to ensure proper resource management.

97. **What are the advantages of using the `try-with-resources` statement in Java?**
    - Answer: The `try-with-resources` statement in Java automatically closes resources that implement the `AutoCloseable` interface, such as files, streams, and database connections. It ensures that resources are properly released, even if an exception occurs during resource usage.

98. **What is the `transient` keyword used for in Java?**
    - Answer: The `transient` keyword is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized during object serialization. When an object is deserialized, `transient` fields will have their default values, as they were not saved during the serialization process.

99. **What is the purpose of the `assert` keyword in Java?**
    - Answer: The `assert` keyword in Java is used for program debugging and testing. It allows you to check if certain conditions hold true during program execution. If an `assert` condition is false, an `AssertionError` is thrown.

100. **What is the `strictfp` keyword used for in Java?**
    - Answer: The `strictfp` keyword is used to ensure consistent floating-point calculations across different platforms. When a class or method is marked as `strictfp`, all floating-point calculations in that class or method follow strict IEEE-754 standards, irrespective of the underlying platform's floating-point behavior.
