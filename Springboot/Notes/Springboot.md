### 1. what is springboot and how does it differ from spring framework

Spring Boot is a framework developed on top of the Spring framework, designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building production-ready Spring applications. It provides a set of opinionated defaults and conventions that eliminate the need for much of the boilerplate configuration that Spring applications traditionally require. Spring Boot is not a replacement for Spring but rather an extension that enhances its capabilities and streamlines development.

Key differences between Spring Boot and the Spring framework:

1. **Configuration:**
   - Spring: In the traditional Spring framework, developers have to manually configure various components by writing XML configuration or Java-based configuration classes.
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot uses sensible default configurations and auto-configuration to automatically configure most of the components based on the classpath and dependencies. Developers only need to provide minimal configuration for their specific use cases.

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Spring: Managing dependencies and version conflicts can be challenging in Spring applications, requiring the developer to explicitly define and maintain dependencies.
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot uses its "starter" dependencies to manage and provide a curated set of compatible dependencies. Developers need to include specific starters for functionalities they require, and Spring Boot takes care of the rest, ensuring version compatibility.

3. **Embedded Servers:**
   - Spring: In the traditional Spring framework, developers need to deploy their applications in external servlet containers like Tomcat, Jetty, etc.
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot comes with an embedded web server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) by default. This allows developers to run applications as standalone JAR files without requiring external containers, making it easier to deploy and distribute applications.

4. **Simplified Annotations:**
   - Spring: The Spring framework uses various annotations for component scanning, configuration, dependency injection, etc., which can lead to verbose code.
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot provides simplified annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, which combines multiple annotations, such as `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`, into a single convenient annotation.

5. **Actuator:**
   - Spring: The traditional Spring framework doesn't provide built-in support for monitoring and managing applications.
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot includes the Actuator module, which offers production-ready features like health checks, metrics, info endpoints, etc., to monitor and manage applications easily.

6. **Externalized Configuration:**
   - Spring: In Spring, developers must manually configure property sources to externalize configuration.
   - Spring Boot: Spring Boot provides support for externalized configuration using properties files, YAML files, environment variables, and command-line arguments, making it easier to change application behavior without modifying the code.

In summary, Spring Boot is an opinionated extension of the Spring framework that streamlines the development process by providing sensible defaults, auto-configuration, embedded servers, and other production-ready features. It reduces the boilerplate code and makes it faster and easier to develop Spring applications without sacrificing the flexibility and power of the underlying Spring framework.

### 2. How to we connect database to springboot

In Spring Boot, you can configure the database connection using both the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file and a custom `@Configuration` class. Here's how you can do it:

**1. Using application.properties (or application.yml):**

Step 1: Open your `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file and add the following properties:

For example, let's configure a connection to a MySQL database:

In `application.properties`:

```properties
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=db_user
spring.datasource.password=db_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

In `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: db_user
    password: db_password
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

Replace `mydb`, `db_user`, and `db_password` with your actual database name, username, and password, respectively. Also, ensure that you specify the correct JDBC driver class for your database.

**2. Using a Custom @Configuration class:**

Step 1: Create a custom configuration class that defines the data source and other database properties. For example:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder;
import javax.sql.DataSource;

@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder
            .create()
            .url("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb")
            .username("db_user")
            .password("db_password")
            .driverClassName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver")
            .build();
    }
}
```

Replace the URL, username, password, and driver class name with the appropriate values for your database.

Step 2: Ensure that the custom configuration class is scanned by Spring. You can place it in the same package as your main application class or use `@ComponentScan` to include the package containing the configuration class.

Using either of these methods, Spring Boot will automatically set up the database connection based on the provided properties, and you can start accessing the database in your application using Spring Data JPA, JDBC, or any other data access method you prefer.

Both approaches are valid and offer flexibility based on your project requirements. The `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file is typically used for simple configurations, while the custom `@Configuration` class gives you more control and allows for complex data source setups, such as connection pooling and other customizations.


### 3. what is purpose of @Springboot Annotation

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a core and essential annotation in Spring Boot. It serves multiple purposes and acts as a combination of three different annotations:

1. **@SpringBootConfiguration:**
   - This annotation indicates that the class is a configuration class for a Spring Boot application. It is used in place of the traditional `@Configuration` annotation.

2. **@EnableAutoConfiguration:**
   - The `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It allows Spring Boot to automatically configure beans and components based on the dependencies present in the classpath and the configuration provided.

3. **@ComponentScan:**
   - The `@ComponentScan` annotation enables component scanning in the Spring Boot application. It instructs Spring to scan and detect Spring components (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, `@Repository`, etc.) within specific packages and register them in the application context.

By combining these three annotations into `@SpringBootApplication`, developers can mark the main class of their Spring Boot application concisely. It simplifies the configuration setup and reduces the need for multiple annotations.

Here's an example of using `@SpringBootApplication`:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

In the above example, `@SpringBootApplication` is used to annotate the main class `MySpringBootApplication`. This annotation allows Spring Boot to automatically configure the application and set up the necessary beans and components for the application to run.

With `@SpringBootApplication`, developers can focus on writing the business logic and let Spring Boot handle the majority of the configuration, reducing the boilerplate code and making it easier to build Spring Boot applications.

### 4. what is the significance of @Autowired annotation

The `@Autowired` annotation is a fundamental and essential annotation in the Spring framework, including Spring Boot. It plays a crucial role in enabling dependency injection, which is one of the core features of Spring. The `@Autowired` annotation allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into the classes, reducing the manual instantiation and wiring of beans.

Significance of `@Autowired` in Spring Boot:

1. **Dependency Injection:**
   - The primary significance of `@Autowired` is to facilitate dependency injection. When you annotate a field, constructor, or setter method with `@Autowired`, Spring Boot automatically resolves and injects the corresponding dependency into the annotated component.
   - For example, if a service class requires a repository instance, you can simply add `@Autowired` to the repository field, and Spring Boot will automatically inject the repository bean into the service.

2. **Reduces Boilerplate Code:**
   - `@Autowired` reduces the boilerplate code related to manual instantiation and wiring of dependencies. It simplifies the codebase and makes it more readable and maintainable.

3. **Loose Coupling:**
   - By using `@Autowired`, classes become loosely coupled, as the dependencies are injected at runtime. This allows for better modularization and easier testing through the use of mock objects during testing.

4. **Support for Constructor, Field, and Method Injection:**
   - `@Autowired` can be used for constructor injection, field injection, or method injection.
   - Constructor injection is often considered a best practice as it ensures that the dependencies are set at object creation time, promoting immutability.

5. **Implicit Bean Wiring:**
   - When you use `@Autowired`, Spring Boot looks for beans of the required type in the application context and wires them automatically, provided there is exactly one bean of that type.
   - If there are multiple beans of the same type, you can use additional qualifiers or `@Primary` to specify the desired bean.

Example of `@Autowired` in Spring Boot:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final MyRepository myRepository;

    @Autowired // Constructor Injection
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        // Access MyRepository methods using myRepository instance
        myRepository.save(data);
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `MyService` class uses constructor injection with `@Autowired` to inject the `MyRepository` bean automatically. This allows `MyService` to use methods from `MyRepository` without explicitly creating a new instance of `MyRepository`.

Overall, `@Autowired` is a powerful and convenient annotation in Spring Boot that simplifies dependency injection, promoting the principle of Inversion of Control (IoC) and making it easier to manage and wire components in your application.

### 5. how do you handle exceptions in springboot application

In a Spring Boot application, you can handle exceptions using several approaches and techniques. Here's a guide on how to handle exceptions effectively:

1. **Using `@ExceptionHandler`:**
   - Spring Boot provides the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation that allows you to handle exceptions at the controller level. By adding this annotation to a method in your controller, you can specify how to handle specific exceptions thrown within that controller.
   - You can return a custom error response, redirect to an error page, or perform any other action based on the exception.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGeneralException(Exception ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Internal Server Error");
    }
}
```

2. **Using `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`:**
   - The `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` class is a convenient base class provided by Spring Boot to handle common exceptions and return customized responses.
   - You can extend this class and override specific methods to handle different types of exceptions.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class CustomResponseEntityExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    protected ResponseEntity<Object> handleResourceNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex, WebRequest request) {
        String message = "Resource not found";
        ApiError apiError = new ApiError(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, message, ex.getMessage());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(apiError, apiError.getStatus());
    }
}
```

3. **Using `@ControllerAdvice`:**
   - The `@ControllerAdvice` annotation allows you to define global exception handling across the entire application. You can define exception handling methods in a single class and annotate it with `@ControllerAdvice`.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Internal Server Error");
    }
}
```

4. **Using `@RestControllerAdvice`:**
   - Similar to `@ControllerAdvice`, you can use `@RestControllerAdvice` for global exception handling, specifically for RESTful APIs.
   - It combines the features of `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ResponseBody`, allowing you to return JSON or XML responses directly from the exception handling methods.

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value(), ex.getMessage());
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(errorResponse);
    }
}
```

5. **Using `@ResponseStatus`:**
   - You can use the `@ResponseStatus` annotation on a custom exception class to define the HTTP status code to be returned when the exception occurs.

```java
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    // Exception implementation
}
```

6. **Using `HandlerExceptionResolver`:**
   - For more advanced exception handling scenarios, you can implement a custom `HandlerExceptionResolver`.
   - It allows you to define complex exception resolution logic and customize the response format.

These are some of the ways to handle exceptions in a Spring Boot application. Choose the approach that best suits your project's requirements and provides a clean and consistent way to handle errors throughout your application.

### 6. Explain the concept of profiles in springboot application and how do you use them

In a Spring Boot application, profiles are used to define different configurations for different environments or scenarios. Profiles allow you to customize the behavior of your application based on the targeted runtime environment, development stage, or specific requirements. This way, you can easily switch between configurations without modifying the application's code.

Using profiles, you can define multiple sets of properties, beans, and configurations, and activate the appropriate profile during application startup.

**How to Use Profiles in Spring Boot:**

1. **Defining Profiles:**
   - Profiles are defined in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file using the syntax `spring.profiles.active=profileName1,profileName2`.
   - You can define multiple profiles by separating them with commas.

2. **Creating Profile-Specific Configuration Files:**
   - Spring Boot allows you to create profile-specific property files. The naming convention for these files is `application-profileName.properties` or `application-profileName.yml`.
   - For example, if you have a profile named "dev," you can create a file named `application-dev.properties` or `application-dev.yml`.

3. **Setting Profile Properties:**
   - In the profile-specific property files, you can define properties that override the default properties defined in the main `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
   - These profile-specific properties will be applied only when the corresponding profile is active.

4. **Activating Profiles:**
   - There are several ways to activate a profile in a Spring Boot application:
     - In `application.properties` or `application.yml`: Set `spring.profiles.active=profileName` to activate the desired profile during application startup.
     - As command-line arguments: Use the `--spring.profiles.active=profileName` option when running the application.
     - As environment variables: Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to the desired profile name.
     - In the application configuration class: Use the `@ActiveProfiles` annotation to activate profiles programmatically.

5. **Default Profile:**
   - You can also define a default profile that is activated when no specific profile is specified.
   - To set a default profile, use `spring.profiles.default=profileName` in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a Spring Boot application that connects to different databases based on the environment. You can define two profiles, "dev" and "prod," each with its database configuration.

1. `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
   spring.datasource.username=db_user
   spring.datasource.password=db_password
   ```

2. `application-dev.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://dev_db_server:3306/dev_db
   spring.datasource.username=dev_db_user
   spring.datasource.password=dev_db_password
   ```

3. `application-prod.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://prod_db_server:3306/prod_db
   spring.datasource.username=prod_db_user
   spring.datasource.password=prod_db_password
   ```

Now, you can activate the "dev" or "prod" profile during application startup:

- To run the application with the "dev" profile:

  ```
  java -jar your-application.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
  ```

- To run the application with the "prod" profile:

  ```
  java -jar your-application.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
  ```

By using profiles, you can easily switch between different configurations and ensure your application behaves differently in various environments without modifying the codebase.


### 7. how to use multiple databases in springboot?

Using multiple databases in a Spring Boot application is a common scenario, especially in complex applications where data needs to be stored in different databases or data sources. Spring Boot provides built-in support for configuring and using multiple data sources. Here's how you can use multiple databases in a Spring Boot application:

1. **Define Multiple Data Source Configurations:**
   - Start by defining separate configurations for each data source. Create separate configuration classes for each data source, and specify the connection properties for each database.

```java
@Configuration
public class PrimaryDataSourceConfig {

    @Primary
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.primary") // Specify properties prefix for primary data source
    public DataSource primaryDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }
}

@Configuration
public class SecondaryDataSourceConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.secondary") // Specify properties prefix for secondary data source
    public DataSource secondaryDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }
}
```

2. **Define Properties for Each Data Source:**
   - In the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file, define the properties for each data source separately, using different prefixes.

In `application.properties`:

```properties
# Primary Data Source Configuration
spring.datasource.primary.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/primary_db
spring.datasource.primary.username=primary_user
spring.datasource.primary.password=primary_password
spring.datasource.primary.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Secondary Data Source Configuration
spring.datasource.secondary.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/secondary_db
spring.datasource.secondary.username=secondary_user
spring.datasource.secondary.password=secondary_password
spring.datasource.secondary.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

3. **Create Separate JdbcTemplate (or JPA) Instances:**
   - Now, create separate `JdbcTemplate` or `EntityManager` instances for each data source, allowing you to interact with multiple databases.

```java
@Configuration
public class JdbcTemplateConfig {

    @Primary
    @Bean(name = "primaryJdbcTemplate")
    public JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate(@Qualifier("primaryDataSource") DataSource dataSource) {
        return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
    }

    @Bean(name = "secondaryJdbcTemplate")
    public JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate(@Qualifier("secondaryDataSource") DataSource dataSource) {
        return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
    }
}
```

4. **Use the Data Sources in Your Components:**
   - Now you can use the different data sources in your services or repositories by injecting the appropriate `JdbcTemplate` or `EntityManager`.

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate;
    private final JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(@Qualifier("primaryJdbcTemplate") JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate,
                     @Qualifier("secondaryJdbcTemplate") JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate) {
        this.primaryJdbcTemplate = primaryJdbcTemplate;
        this.secondaryJdbcTemplate = secondaryJdbcTemplate;
    }

    // Use primaryJdbcTemplate and secondaryJdbcTemplate for database operations
}
```

By following these steps, you can use multiple databases in your Spring Boot application. You can extend this approach to use multiple JPA entity managers for JPA-based applications or different data access methods for each database. Spring Boot's flexible configuration and dependency injection capabilities make it easy to manage multiple data sources and databases in your application.

### 8. how do you deploy springboot application in external tomcat server

To deploy a Spring Boot application in an external Tomcat server, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a War Package:**
   - By default, Spring Boot applications are packaged as executable JAR files. However, when deploying to an external Tomcat server, you need to package your application as a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.
   - Update the `pom.xml` file (if you're using Maven) to change the packaging type from `jar` to `war`.

```xml
<packaging>war</packaging>
```

2. **Disable the Embedded Server:**
   - Spring Boot includes an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) by default to run the application standalone. When deploying to an external Tomcat server, you need to disable the embedded server.
   - You can do this by excluding the embedded server dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <!-- Exclude the embedded server -->
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

3. **Adjust Application Entry Point:**
   - Spring Boot requires a special application entry point when running as a WAR. Create a class that extends `SpringBootServletInitializer` and override the `configure` method.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder;
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitializer;

public class ServletInitializer extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {
        return application.sources(YourSpringBootApplication.class);
    }
}
```

4. **Build the War File:**
   - Build the WAR file using your build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle). For Maven, run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

5. **Deploy to Tomcat:**
   - Once you have the WAR file (usually located in the `target` directory), deploy it to your external Tomcat server.
   - Copy the generated WAR file to the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation.

6. **Start Tomcat Server:**
   - Start your Tomcat server. You can do this from the command line or using the provided scripts based on your operating system.

7. **Access Your Application:**
   - Once the Tomcat server is up and running, you should be able to access your Spring Boot application at the following URL (assuming you haven't changed the context path):
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/your-application-context-path
     ```
   - Replace `your-application-context-path` with the context path of your Spring Boot application.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy your Spring Boot application to an external Tomcat server. Remember that Spring Boot's opinionated defaults work seamlessly with embedded servers, so you may need to make some adjustments when deploying to an external container.

Sure! Here are 20 Spring Boot interview questions with answers and examples:

1. **What is Spring Boot?**
   - Answer: Spring Boot is an opinionated framework for building production-ready Spring applications with minimal configuration. It simplifies the development process by providing defaults and auto-configurations while allowing customization when needed.

2. **What are the key features of Spring Boot?**
   - Answer: Key features of Spring Boot include:
     - Auto-configuration
     - Standalone applications with embedded servers
     - Production-ready features (e.g., health checks, metrics)
     - Opinionated development approach
     - Starter dependencies

3. **What is the purpose of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation?**
   - Answer: The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a combination of three annotations (`@SpringBootConfiguration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`). It marks the main class of the Spring Boot application and enables auto-configuration and component scanning.

4. **What is the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?**
   - Answer: Both annotations are used to define controller classes. However, `@RestController` is specifically used for RESTful web services and is a combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

Example:
```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

5. **Explain the Spring Boot starter concept.**
   - Answer: Spring Boot starters are dependency descriptors that simplify the inclusion of dependencies in your project. They provide a convenient way to add groups of dependencies needed for specific functionalities, such as web, data access, security, etc.

Example:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> <!-- Starter for web applications -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

6. **What is Spring Data JPA?**
   - Answer: Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Data project that simplifies data access using JPA (Java Persistence API). It provides a repository-based approach to perform CRUD operations without writing boilerplate data access code.

Example:
```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Custom queries are automatically implemented by Spring Data JPA based on method names
    List<User> findByFirstName(String firstName);
}
```

7. **How do you enable CORS in a Spring Boot application?**
   - Answer: You can enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Spring Boot by adding the `@CrossOrigin` annotation to your controller methods or by configuring CORS globally using a `WebMvcConfigurer`.

Example:
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:8080")
    @GetMapping("/data")
    public String getData() {
        return "Data";
    }
}
```

8. **What is the purpose of the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file?**
   - Answer: The `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file is used to provide configuration properties for your Spring Boot application. It allows you to customize various settings, such as the server port, database connection, logging, etc.

Example (`application.properties`):
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=db_user
spring.datasource.password=db_password
```

9. **Explain the use of the `@Autowired` annotation in Spring Boot.**
   - Answer: The `@Autowired` annotation is used for dependency injection. It allows Spring Boot to automatically wire beans and dependencies together, reducing the need for manual bean instantiation and wiring.

Example:
```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final MyRepository myRepository;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }

    // Use myRepository for data access operations
}
```

10. **How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: You can handle exceptions in Spring Boot using `@ExceptionHandler` at the controller level, `@ControllerAdvice` for global exception handling, or by extending `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`.

Example (Controller-level Exception Handling):
```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/data/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Data> getData(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Data data = myService.getDataById(id);
        if (data == null) {
            throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Data not found for id: " + id);
        }
        return ResponseEntity.ok(data);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

11. **What is the purpose of the `@Qualifier` annotation?**
    - Answer: The `@Qualifier` annotation is used when multiple beans of the same type are available in the application context. It helps Spring Boot to resolve the correct bean to be injected based on the qualifier value provided.

Example:
```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    private final MyRepository myRepository;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(@Qualifier("mysqlRepository") MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }

    // Use myRepository for data access operations
}
```

12. **How do you configure a database connection in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: You can configure a database connection in Spring Boot by providing the necessary properties in the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file, along with the appropriate database driver dependency.

Example (`application.properties`):
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=db_user
spring.datasource.password=db_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

13. **What is Spring Security in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: Spring Security is a powerful authentication and authorization framework in Spring Boot. It provides comprehensive security features for securing web applications, RESTful services, and more.

Example:
```java

14. **Explain the purpose of Spring Boot Actuator.**
    - Answer: Spring Boot Actuator is a module that provides production-ready

 features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring for Spring Boot applications. It enables monitoring and managing the application in production environments.

15. **How do you configure logging in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: Spring Boot uses Commons Logging by default. You can configure logging by specifying properties in the `application.properties` file or using a custom `logback.xml` or `log4j2.xml` configuration.

Example (`application.properties`):
```properties
# Log levels for specific packages or classes
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.com.example=INFO

# Logging file and format
logging.file=logs/myapp.log
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

16. **What is the role of `@RequestMapping` in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: `@RequestMapping` is used to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods. It defines the URL pattern that triggers the method execution.

Example:
```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/data")
    public String getData() {
        return "Data";
    }
}
```

17. **Explain the use of the `@Value` annotation in Spring Boot.**
    - Answer: The `@Value` annotation is used to inject values from the `application.properties` file into Spring beans. It allows you to externalize configuration and inject property values at runtime.

Example (`application.properties`):
```properties
myapp.title=My Application
```

Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {

    @Value("${myapp.title}")
    private String appTitle;

    // Use appTitle in your component
}
```

18. **What is the purpose of the `@Configuration` annotation in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: The `@Configuration` annotation indicates that the class is a configuration class and may contain bean definitions. It is used in conjunction with `@Bean` to define beans programmatically.

Example:
```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}
```

19. **How do you handle form data and query parameters in Spring Boot?**
    - Answer: Form data and query parameters can be handled in Spring Boot by using `@RequestParam` for query parameters and `@ModelAttribute` for form data in controller methods.

Example:
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @PostMapping("/save")
    public String saveData(@ModelAttribute Data data) {
        // Save data to the database
        return "success";
    }

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public String searchData(@RequestParam String keyword) {
        // Search data based on the keyword
        return "searchResult";
    }
}
```

20. **What is the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint?**
    - Answer: Spring Boot Actuator exposes various endpoints to provide production-ready features, such as health checks (`/actuator/health`), metrics (`/actuator/metrics`), and more. These endpoints can be used for monitoring and managing the application.

Example (Health Check Endpoint):
```
GET /actuator/health
```

These are some common Spring Boot interview questions along with their answers and examples. Remember to understand the concepts and practice hands-on coding to strengthen your knowledge and skills in Spring Boot. Good luck with your interviews!

21. **CRUD vs JPA repository?**

`CRUD` and `JpaRepository` are both related to data access in Spring Boot applications, but they serve different purposes:

1. **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete):**
   - CRUD refers to the four basic operations performed on data in a database: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
   - In the context of Spring Boot applications, developers often implement custom data access methods for CRUD operations using standard JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), JdbcTemplate, or native SQL queries.
   - CRUD operations allow you to interact with the database and perform essential data manipulation tasks.

2. **JpaRepository:**
   - `JpaRepository` is an interface provided by Spring Data JPA, which is part of the Spring Data project. It simplifies data access by providing built-in methods for common database operations, including CRUD operations.
   - It is an extension of the `CrudRepository` interface, which, in turn, extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface.
   - By extending `JpaRepository`, you can inherit the basic CRUD functionality without having to write custom implementations for data access.

Example of Custom CRUD Repository:
```java
public interface EmployeeRepository {
    List<Employee> findAll();
    Employee findById(Long id);
    Employee save(Employee employee);
    void deleteById(Long id);
}
```

Example of JpaRepository:
```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
}
```

In the above examples, `EmployeeRepository` is a custom CRUD repository that defines custom methods for data access. It requires manual implementation of each method.

On the other hand, `EmployeeRepository` extending `JpaRepository<Employee, Long>` automatically provides basic CRUD methods like `findAll()`, `findById()`, `save()`, `deleteById()`, etc., which are implemented by Spring Data JPA based on method names.

Using `JpaRepository` simplifies data access in Spring Boot applications and follows the convention-over-configuration principle. It leverages the power of JPA and Hibernate to handle database operations and entity mapping, reducing the need for boilerplate code and allowing developers to focus on business logic.
