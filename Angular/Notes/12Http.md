Certainly, here's a list of 20 top Angular HTTP interview questions along with answers and examples:

**1. What is Angular HTTPClient module used for?**
   
   **Answer:** The Angular `HttpClient` module is used to make HTTP requests to a server. It provides methods to send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. requests and handles responses in a more streamlined and modern way compared to the older `Http` module.

**2. How do you make an HTTP GET request using Angular HttpClient?**
   
   **Answer:** Here's an example of making an HTTP GET request using `HttpClient`:

   ```typescript
   import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

   constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

   fetchData() {
     return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
   }
   ```

**3. How can you handle the response of an HTTP GET request?**
   
   **Answer:** You can handle the response using the `subscribe()` method provided by the `Observable` returned by the HTTP request. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   fetchData() {
     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe((response) => {
       console.log(response);
     });
   }
   ```

**4. What are HTTP Interceptors in Angular and how are they useful?**
   
   **Answer:** HTTP Interceptors allow you to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses globally across your application. They are useful for tasks like adding authentication headers, logging, or error handling. You can create an interceptor by implementing the `HttpInterceptor` interface.

**5. How do you handle errors in Angular HTTP requests?**
   
   **Answer:** You can handle errors in HTTP requests using the `catchError` operator along with the `throwError` function from the `rxjs` library. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';
   import { throwError } from 'rxjs';

   fetchData() {
     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
       .pipe(
         catchError(error => {
           console.error('An error occurred:', error);
           return throwError('Something went wrong');
         })
       )
       .subscribe(response => {
         console.log(response);
       });
   }
   ```

**6. How can you send data in an HTTP POST request using Angular HttpClient?**
   
   **Answer:** You can send data in an HTTP POST request using the `post()` method of `HttpClient`. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
   this.http.post('https://api.example.com/addUser', data)
     .subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
   ```

**7. What is the purpose of the `params` option in HTTP requests?**
   
   **Answer:** The `params` option is used to send query parameters in the URL of an HTTP request. These parameters are used to filter or modify the data you receive from the server. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   const params = { page: '1', limit: '10' };
   this.http.get('https://api.example.com/users', { params })
     .subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
   ```

**8. How can you send headers in an HTTP request using Angular HttpClient?**
   
   **Answer:** You can send headers using the `headers` option in HTTP requests. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   const headers = new HttpHeaders({
     'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token',
     'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   });

   const options = { headers: headers };
   
   this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data', options)
     .subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
   ```

**9. How do you handle multiple concurrent HTTP requests in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can use the `forkJoin` operator from the `rxjs` library to handle multiple concurrent requests and wait for all of them to complete. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { forkJoin } from 'rxjs';

   fetchData() {
     const request1 = this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data1');
     const request2 = this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data2');

     forkJoin([request1, request2]).subscribe(responses => {
       const response1 = responses[0];
       const response2 = responses[1];
       console.log(response1, response2);
     });
   }
   ```

**10. How can you cancel an ongoing HTTP request in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** Angular's `HttpClient` does not provide built-in support for canceling requests. However, you can use the `takeUntil` operator in combination with an RxJS Subject to achieve cancellation. Here's a simplified example:

   ```typescript
   import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
   import { takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';

   private ngUnsubscribe = new Subject();

   fetchData() {
     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
       .pipe(takeUntil(this.ngUnsubscribe))
       .subscribe(response => {
         console.log(response);
       });
   }

   ngOnDestroy() {
     this.ngUnsubscribe.next();
     this.ngUnsubscribe.complete();
   }
   ```

**11. How can you perform error handling for multiple HTTP requests in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can use the `forkJoin` operator along with the `catchError` operator to handle errors for multiple requests. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { forkJoin, throwError } from 'rxjs';
   import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

   fetchData() {
     const request1 = this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data1').pipe(
       catchError(error => throwError('Error in request 1'))
     );

     const request2 = this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data2').pipe(
       catchError(error => throwError('Error in request 2'))
     );

     forkJoin([request1, request2]).subscribe(
       responses => {
         const response1 = responses[0];
         const response2 = responses[1];
         console.log(response1, response2);
       },
       error => {
         console.error(error);
       }
     );
   }
   ```

**12. How can you set up authentication headers for all HTTP requests in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can create an HTTP Interceptor to add authentication headers to all outgoing HTTP requests. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
   import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';

   @Injectable()
   export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
     intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
       const authToken = 'your-auth-token';
       const authReq = request.clone({
         headers: new HttpHeaders({
           'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`
         })
       });
       return next.handle(authReq);
     }
   }
   ```

**13. How can you handle progress events for HTTP requests in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can use the `observe` option in HTTP requests to receive progress events. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   this.http.get('https://api.example.com/largeFile', { observe

: 'events' })
     .subscribe(event => {
       if (event.type === HttpEventType.DownloadProgress) {
         const percentDone = Math.round(100 * event.loaded / event.total);
         console.log(`Progress: ${percentDone}%`);
       } else if (event.type === HttpEventType.Response) {
         console.log('Request completed!', event.body);
       }
     });
   ```

**14. How can you handle timeouts for HTTP requests in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can use the `timeout` operator from the `rxjs` library to handle timeouts for HTTP requests. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { timeout, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

   fetchData() {
     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
       .pipe(
         timeout(5000), // Timeout after 5 seconds
         catchError(error => throwError('Request timed out'))
       )
       .subscribe(response => {
         console.log(response);
       });
   }
   ```

**15. What is lazy loading of modules in Angular and how can it affect HTTP requests?**
   
   **Answer:** Lazy loading is a feature in Angular that loads modules only when they are needed, reducing the initial loading time of an application. When a module is lazily loaded, its associated HTTP requests (like fetching component templates) are also loaded when the module is accessed for the first time.

**16. How can you mock HTTP requests for unit testing in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can use Angular's `HttpClientTestingModule` to mock HTTP requests during unit testing. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   import { TestBed, inject } from '@angular/core/testing';
   import { HttpClientTestingModule, HttpTestingController } from '@angular/common/http/testing';
   import { YourService } from './your.service';

   describe('YourService', () => {
     beforeEach(() => {
       TestBed.configureTestingModule({
         imports: [HttpClientTestingModule],
         providers: [YourService]
       });
     });

     it('should retrieve data', inject([YourService, HttpTestingController], (service: YourService, httpMock: HttpTestingController) => {
       const testData = { /* test data here */ };

       service.getData().subscribe(data => {
         expect(data).toEqual(testData);
       });

       const req = httpMock.expectOne('https://api.example.com/data');
       expect(req.request.method).toBe('GET');
       req.flush(testData);

       httpMock.verify();
     }));
   });
   ```

**17. How can you configure a base URL for HTTP requests in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** You can configure a base URL by providing the `baseURL` property in the `@Injectable()` decorator of a service that uses `HttpClient`. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root',
     baseURL: 'https://api.example.com' // Your base URL here
   })
   export class YourService {
     constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

     fetchData() {
       return this.http.get('/data'); // Appends to the base URL
     }
   }
   ```

**18. How do you handle CORS issues in Angular HTTP requests?**
   
   **Answer:** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues can be handled by configuring the server to allow requests from the client's domain. Additionally, on the client-side, you can set up a proxy configuration (`proxy.conf.json`) during development to bypass CORS restrictions:

   ```json
   {
     "/api": {
       "target": "https://api.example.com",
       "secure": false
     }
   }
   ```

**19. How can you send data in an HTTP PUT request using Angular HttpClient?**
   
   **Answer:** You can send data in an HTTP PUT request using the `put()` method of `HttpClient`. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   const data = { id: 123, name: 'Updated Name' };
   this.http.put('https://api.example.com/updateUser', data)
     .subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
   ```

**20. How can you cancel an ongoing HTTP request in Angular?**
   
   **Answer:** Angular's `HttpClient` does not provide built-in support for canceling requests. However, you can use the `takeUntil` operator in combination with an RxJS Subject to achieve cancellation. Here's a simplified example:

   ```typescript
   import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
   import { takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';

   private ngUnsubscribe = new Subject();

   fetchData() {
     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')
       .pipe(takeUntil(this.ngUnsubscribe))
       .subscribe(response => {
         console.log(response);
       });
   }

   ngOnDestroy() {
     this.ngUnsubscribe.next();
     this.ngUnsubscribe.complete();
   }
   ```
